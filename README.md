# FireblastExample

If you want to mess around with Fireblast this file is a good starting point:
`lib/fireblast_example_web/views/fireblast_view.ex`

You don't need to split things as much as I've done and you can define modules
in different files. But this is just meant as an example.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
