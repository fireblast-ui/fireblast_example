# FireblastExample

## Fireblast

Is a way of making reusable components to build HTML files in a XML syntax
similar to JSX which is used by React, Preact and Stencil.js. This allows people
more used to that workflow to be faster at using Phoenix. If you are more used
to a templating workflow coming from Rails or Django I would recommend just using
Phoenix by itself.

## Where to look

If you want to mess around with Fireblast this file is a good starting point:
`lib/fireblast_example_web/views/fireblast_view.ex`

You don't need to split things as much as I've done and you can define modules
in different files. But this is just meant as an example.

## Get started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
